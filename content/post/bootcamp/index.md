I’m thrilled to share that I’ve officially completed the **Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp** at Tecnológico de Monterrey!

This past week, I received my certificate of completion, marking the end of a truly transformative journey. Taking this first step toward transitioning into the tech world wasn’t easy — it was a path filled with learning, growth, and self-discovery. But today, I feel more ready than ever to explore new opportunities in the data and tech ecosystem.

## 🔍 What I Learned

During the bootcamp, I strengthened my skills in Python, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, APIs, and data visualization. I also applied them in real-world projects, which I’m proud to showcase on my [GitHub](https://github.com/itzelvazsan).

Topics I covered included:

- Unsupervised Learning  
- Supervised Learning  
- Neural Networks and Deep Learning  
- Big Data  
- Data Analysis with Python  
- Python APIs  
- NoSQL Databases  
- ETL Processes  
- JavaScript Visualizations  

## 🙌 Gratitude

A special thanks to our amazing professor **John Ellis**, our dedicated TA **Kaylie Butler**, and my incredible classmates. Your support made this experience all the more meaningful.
