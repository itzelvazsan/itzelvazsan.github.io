abstract: This is the result of a project where I proposed and prepared an Excel-based data collection tool to assess sustainable and gender-focused financial products within Mexican cooperative societies. I also coordinated the initial data collection test with 9 cooperatives and a pilot phase with 33 cooperatives. Finally, I analyzed the data and presented key findings that shaped and strengthened the national financial strategy, significantly improving data-driven decision-making.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
