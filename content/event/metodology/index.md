The main goal of my lecture was to introduce Actuarial Science students to the concept of academic research through an accessible approach. While some students were interested in research because they plan to pursue graduate studies, this time I chose to frame Research Methodology as a practical tool for making decisions in professional roles such as data analyst or data scientist.

The following authors and works informed the development of my lecture slides:

- Hernández Sampieri, Roberto , Fernández Collado, Carlos , Baptista Lucio, María del Pilar (2014). Metodología de la investigación (6° ed.). México: McGraw Hill Interamericana Editores S.A. de C.V.
- Camm, J. D., Fry, M. J., & Shafer, S. M. (2025). Data Science and Decision Science Skills: Are They Different and Does It Matter? Harvard Data Science Review, 7(3). https://doi.org/10.1162/99608f92.a6370111


I look forward to meeting the next generation of Actuarial Science students next year :sun_with_face:!
