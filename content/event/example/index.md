I supported Dr. Dionisio Zabaleta in explaining the theoretical framework of corruption risks in public procurement, based on prior research conducted on the topic. 

Some authors who contributed to the development of the conceptual framework presented were:

- Fazekas, Skuhrovec y Wachs. 2017. [“Corruption, government turnover, and public contracting market structure Insights using network analysis and objective corruption proxies”](https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3103402)
- Fazekas, M., Toth, I., y King, P., 2013. [Corruption manual for beginners. “Corruption techniques” in public procurement with examples from Hungary](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272304515_Corruption_Manual_for_Beginners_'Corruption_Techniques'_in_Public_Procurement_with_Examples_from_Hungary)
- Tóth, Fazekas, Czibik, János Tóth. 2013. [“Toolkit for detecting collusive bidding in public procurement”](https://www.govtransparency.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/GTI_WP2014_2_Toth_et_al_150413.pdf)

Here are the presentation slides from that class:
