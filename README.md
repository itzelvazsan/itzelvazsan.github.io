[Check out the latest demo](https://academic-demo.netlify.app/), or [get inspired by our academics and research groups](https://hugoblox.com/creators/).

## From Hugo Academic CV Theme: We ask you, humbly, to support this open source movement

Today we ask you to defend the open source independence of the Hugo Blox Builder and themes üêß

We're an open source movement that depends on your support to stay online and thriving, but 99.9% of our creators don't give; they simply look the other way.
